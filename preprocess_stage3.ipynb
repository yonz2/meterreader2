    "# Electricity Meter Reading Pipeline - Stage 3: Digit Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "This document describes the process for training a digit recognition model as part of an electricity meter reading pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are involved in preprocessing the images of the electricity meter counter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:** Take the output of Stage 2, which is an image of the counter area cropped from the original image.\n",
    "2. **Straighten:** Use horizontal line detection (e.g., Hough Line Transform) to estimate the rotation angle and straighten the image. This ensures proper digit alignment.\n",
    "3. **Convert to Binary:**\n",
    "   - Convert the image to grayscale.\n",
    "   - Apply binary thresholding to create a black and white (B/W) image.\n",
    "   - Invert the binary image to make the digits white and the background black.\n",
    "4. **Remove Borders:** Use horizontal line detection to identify and remove any remaining borders above and below the digits. This can be achieved using techniques like inpainting or morphological operations.\n",
    "5. **Isolate Digits:** Apply edge detection (e.g., Canny edge detector) to identify the boundaries of the digits.\n",
    "6. **Filter Contours:** Filter the resulting contours (detected digit boundaries) based on criteria such as:\n",
    "   - Height > Width (digits are usually taller than they are wide)\n",
    "   - Area (height * width) > threshold (to eliminate small noise or artifacts)\n",
    "   - Other conditions as needed (e.g., aspect ratio, solidity)\n",
    "7. **Extract and Save:** Extract each segmented digit and save it as a separate image file."
